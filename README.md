# Mini Message Board

## Purpose
The purpose of making this app was not to create a stylish
app, but to simply practice basic routing concepts with
Express.js and get introduced to templating engines and
how they can be used to serve server-side pages.

## How to Run
1. Once you've downloaded this project, type in `npm install`.
This will install all the dependencies needed by the project.
2. If you want to run a live server in development mode,
type in `npm run startdev`. It uses nodemon to act as a live
server and is reloaded on file saves.
3. If you prefer to run the server normally, run `npm start`.

## Outcomes
Through this project, I managed to learn how templating engines
work at the basic level and how they can be used to serve
requests at the server level and display them on the frontend.

I also leveraged on using `express-generator` to create the
skeleton to run a server app. I'm hoping that this will save
time setting up an environment. 

## Future Work
Once I have more time and have acquired more advanced skills,
I would like to rework the frontend of the app to make it
more interesting for others to see. If possible, I would like
to use `localStorage` to store user settings and a `mongoDB`
cluster to store them and retrieve a history chat. However,
this would have to be done for an application that implements
authentication and more advanced concepts I'm not familiar with
yet. It would be a nice project down the line.
